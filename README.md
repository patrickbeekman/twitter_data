# Twitter Data Web Scraper

This is an evolving project I am working on to help me become familiar with RESTful api's and twitter data. This project is also to help me learn best python development practices, python unit tests, and github. To start I will be doing basic data scraping and analysis, then I hope to evolve this to further more complicated analysis with an end goal of Natural Language Processing on mass swarms of tweets.
